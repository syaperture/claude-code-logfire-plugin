# Logfire plugin for Claude Code

A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin that sends OpenTelemetry traces to [Pydantic Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev), giving you full observability into your Claude Code sessions.

Each session becomes a trace with child spans per LLM API call, with full token usage, cost tracking, and conversation history visible in Logfire.

## Installation

### System requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- A [Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev) project with a write token
- `python3` (3.7+) — pre-installed on macOS and most Linux distributions; uses stdlib only (no pip dependencies)

### Install the plugin

From within Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add pydantic/claude-code-logfire-plugin
/plugin install logfire-session-capture@pydantic-claude-code-logfire-plugin
```

### Update the plugin

```
/plugin update logfire-session-capture@pydantic-claude-code-logfire-plugin
```

### Authenticate to Logfire

The plugin supports two authentication modes. Pick whichever fits your setup —
they're checked in order, so you can have both configured and `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`
will win.

#### Option A: Fixed write token (simplest)

```bash
export LOGFIRE_TOKEN="your-logfire-write-token"
```

Add this to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.) so it persists across sessions.

For the EU region:

```bash
export LOGFIRE_BASE_URL="https://logfire-eu.pydantic.dev"
```

#### Option B: OAuth with automatic refresh (no long-lived secret in your shell)

Run the device flow once — the plugin then refreshes the access token silently
on every hook invocation until you log out:

```bash
# From inside a Claude Code session:
/logfire-session-capture:login

# Or directly from your shell:
python3 ~/.claude/plugins/.../scripts/auth.py login
```

You'll see a one-time user code and a browser opens to authorize the plugin
against your Logfire org / project (RFC 8628 Device Authorization Grant with
PKCE; the access token carries the `project:write_otlp` scope and is bound to
the Fusionfire OTLP intake via the RFC 8707 `resource` parameter). The
`client_id` is a Client ID Metadata Document URL — by default
`https://logfire.pydantic.dev/clients/claude-code-logfire.json` for production
hosts and `https://logfire.pydantic.info/...` for staging — so the
authorization server fetches the canonical client metadata directly and no
per-install registration is needed. On success the access + refresh tokens
are written to `~/.logfire/claude-code-logfire-plugin.json` (mode 0600), along
with the chosen `base_url`. The plugin reads the bundle on every hook event and
exchanges the refresh token whenever the access token is within 60s of expiry;
the new bundle is written back atomically and shared across all your Claude
Code sessions.

Only **one** bundle is stored at a time — re-running `/logfire-session-capture:login`
overwrites it. `logout` / `status` / `refresh` operate on whatever's stored, so
they don't need a `--base-url` argument.

Four slash commands ship with the plugin:

- `/logfire-session-capture:login` — start (or re-run) the device flow (pass `--base-url ...` for EU / self-hosted)
- `/logfire-session-capture:status` — print expiry, scope, and client info for the stored bundle
- `/logfire-session-capture:refresh` — force-exchange the refresh token (debugging / manual rotation; hooks refresh lazily already)
- `/logfire-session-capture:logout` — delete the stored bundle

Unset `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` to make the plugin use the OAuth bundle. If both are
present, `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` wins (no surprise migrations).

#### Configuration reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` | One of token/OAuth | _(none)_ | Logfire write token. Takes precedence over the OAuth bundle when both are present. |
| `LOGFIRE_BASE_URL` | No | `https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev` | Default Logfire ingest endpoint when using `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`; default `--base-url` for `/logfire-session-capture:login`. In OAuth mode the stored bundle's `base_url` wins over this variable. |
| `LOGFIRE_LOCAL_LOG` | No | `false` | Set to `true` to write JSONL event logs locally |
| `LOGFIRE_DIAGNOSTICS` | No | `false` | Set to `true` to write diagnostic logs (enabled automatically when `LOGFIRE_LOCAL_LOG` is set) |
| `LOGFIRE_ENVIRONMENT` | No | _(none)_ | Sets `deployment.environment.name` on every trace (e.g. `production`, `dev`) |
| `LOGFIRE_SESSION_LABEL` | No | `Claude Code session` | Label for the root session span — useful when running multiple CC sessions in one trace |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | No | `claude-code-plugin` | Overrides the `service.name` resource attribute |
| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | No | _(none)_ | Standard OTel env var for additional resource attributes, e.g. `deployment.environment.name=prod,service.instance.id=worker-1` |

Without either `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` or a stored OAuth bundle, no traces are sent.
The plugin does nothing unless at least one auth mode or `LOGFIRE_LOCAL_LOG`
is configured.

## What you get

Every Claude Code session produces a trace in Logfire:

```
Claude Code session              <- root span (the full session)
├── chat claude-opus-4-6         <- LLM API call 1
├── chat claude-opus-4-6         <- LLM API call 2
└── chat claude-opus-4-6         <- LLM API call 3
```

Each `chat` child span includes:

- **Token usage** (`gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`)
- **Cost** (`operation.cost` in USD)
- **Messages** (`gen_ai.input.messages`, `gen_ai.output.messages`)
- **Finish reason** (`gen_ai.response.finish_reasons`)

The root span carries the full conversation, so you can inspect the entire session in Logfire's trace view.

## Distributed tracing

If you call Claude Code from a Python application that already uses Logfire or OpenTelemetry, you can link the Claude Code session into your existing trace by passing a `TRACEPARENT` environment variable:

```bash
TRACEPARENT="00-<trace_id>-<parent_span_id>-01" claude --print "your prompt"
```

See [`examples/distributed-tracing.py`](examples/distributed-tracing.py) for a complete example using `logfire` and `subprocess`.

## Local JSONL log

Set `LOGFIRE_LOCAL_LOG=true` to write all hook events as JSON Lines to `.claude/logs/session-events.jsonl` in the project directory. This is off by default.

## Data collected

When `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` is set, the plugin sends the following data to Logfire as OpenTelemetry span attributes:

| Data | Span | Attribute |
|---|---|---|
| Full conversation (user prompts, assistant responses, tool calls and results) | Root span | `pydantic_ai.all_messages` |
| Per-call input/output messages | Child spans | `gen_ai.input.messages`, `gen_ai.output.messages` |
| Token counts | Child spans | `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` |
| Cost in USD | Child spans | `operation.cost` |
| Model name | Both | `gen_ai.request.model` |
| Working directory | Root span | `session.cwd` |
| Assistant thinking blocks | Child spans | Included in `gen_ai.output.messages` |

**Privacy note:** Conversation data sent to Logfire may contain sensitive information including file contents read by Claude, tool outputs, environment details, and any text in the conversation. Logfire data is stored according to [Pydantic's privacy policy](https://pydantic.dev/privacy). If this is a concern, use `LOGFIRE_LOCAL_LOG=true` without `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` to keep all data local.

## Troubleshooting

**Enable diagnostics** to see what the plugin is doing:

```bash
export LOGFIRE_DIAGNOSTICS=true
```

Diagnostic logs are written to `.claude/logs/diagnostics.jsonl` in the project directory.

**Common issues:**

- **No traces appearing in Logfire** -- Check that `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` is set and valid, or that `/logfire-session-capture:status` reports a stored OAuth bundle. Enable diagnostics to see if OTLP exports are failing.
- **Export errors (HTTP 401/403)** -- Your Logfire token may be invalid or expired. Generate a new write token in the Logfire console, or run `/logfire-session-capture:login` to refresh the OAuth bundle.
- **OAuth refresh keeps failing** -- The refresh token may have been revoked or expired. Run `/logfire-session-capture:logout` then `/logfire-session-capture:login` to start a fresh flow.
- **Export errors (HTTP 4xx/5xx)** -- Check `LOGFIRE_BASE_URL` if using a non-default region. The plugin logs HTTP status codes to stderr and diagnostics.

## Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run ruff check scripts/
uv run ruff format scripts/
```

## How it works

The plugin is a single Python script ([`scripts/log-event.py`](scripts/log-event.py), stdlib only) invoked by Claude Code hooks on every session event. On `Stop` events it parses the transcript file to extract per-API-call data (deduplicating streaming fragments) and sends OTLP/HTTP JSON to Logfire. On `SessionEnd` it sends the root span with the accumulated conversation.

State is persisted in a temp file between hook invocations. The `trace_id` is deterministically derived from `session_id` via SHA-256.
